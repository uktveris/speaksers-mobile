# Language learning app mobile frontend

> **Note:** the project is still in the development, so some bugs might be present, as well as some features might not be available to a full extent.

The framework used to create this project is [Expo](https://expo.dev). The project itself is a app for practice speaking diaglogues with peers.

## install & lauch

Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

Start the app locally

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

> **Note:** in order to get all features (such as call mechanics), the [backend](https://github.com/uktveris/speaksers-backend) should be also installed and run. It provides features such as websocket signalling for webrtc call peer matching.
